<h2>Description</h2>
The 3D Virtual Object Immersion showcases a 3D virtual capsule integrated into the real world using Unity, the Vuforia AR SDK, and ARCore, demonstrating how augmented reality can seamlessly blend digital content with physical environments. Utilizing C# for scripting, the application allows users to tap on their device screen to place the capsule at a specific location, enhancing interactivity. The capsule features realistic textures and responds to user interactions, such as changing color or scaling, which increases engagement and immersion. Vuforia's image recognition accurately anchors the capsule in the user's surroundings, reacting to their perspective. This demo serves as a foundational example for applications in education, interior design, and gaming, illustrating the potential of AR to enrich user experiences and interactions with the physical world on Android devices.
